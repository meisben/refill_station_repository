Note: That scale is zeroed during program start up. The scale must have no objects placed on it at startup.
ScalingFactor value (from EEPROM): 1588.48
Reading mass set-point value for:  250ml 
 Which has value(g) of: 180
Reading mass set-point value for:  500ml 
 Which has value(g) of: 400
Reading mass set-point value for: 1000ml 
 Which has value(g) of: 471

Now place fluid receptacle and then press 'right' to start pumping

  No container present, mass is: 0.19
Select volume to pump using up, down buttons. Then press right key
Check nozzle is inserted in receptacle, confirm with right key
pumpFluidVolume activated with volume, mass = 1000ml , 471 g
Container mass recorded as =292 g
Total mass to pump =763 g
