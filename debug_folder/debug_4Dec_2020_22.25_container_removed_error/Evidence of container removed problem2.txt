Conclusion: the scale error value is -18, and so it's the averaging of two readings which is causing this problem. But by the same logic, I should constantly keep track of a 'currentZero' in state 1, and when a container is placed and pumping starts, all of the error checking can be relative to this 'current zero' which may take account of soap residue in the drip tray.
